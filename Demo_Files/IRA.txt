The 2025 Medicare Part D redesign caps beneficiary cost-sharing at $2,000 for prescription drugs, meaning copays or cost-sharing become zero after paying $2,000 out-of-pocket, and shifts to a three-phase benefit structure instead of four
Here's a more detailed breakdown of the changes:

• Out-of-Pocket Cap: Beneficiaries will no longer have to pay copays or cost-sharing for Part D drugs after reaching a $2,000 out-of-pocket limit. 
• Three-Phase Structure: The Part D benefit structure will transition from four phases (deductible, initial coverage, coverage gap, and catastrophic coverage) to three phases: deductible, initial coverage, and catastrophic coverage. 
• Monthly Payment Option: Beneficiaries can pay their Part D out-of-pocket costs monthly throughout the year, rather than at the pharmacy, which can help smooth out financial demands. 
• Catastrophic Phase Entry: Some beneficiaries can enter the catastrophic phase on Day 1 of the contract year with a high-cost drug.
